                    <p><b>Scott Raymond Henry</b>- An East Coast transplant in the early 70's, Scott found his place here in North County and focused his human capacity on building, designing and refining hand-shaped custom surfboards. Never straying from the path of a 100% hand made from start to finish surfboard, Scott has etched a name for himself in the SD surf community. Scott has been working at Mitch's for over 20 years and continues to lend his bulk of knowledge and  friendly demeanor on Saturday afternoons. When not traveling the world as a point break junkie Scott is our resident ding repair guru and has proved he can make most anything nice again.</p>

With a track record that speaks for itself, this fella has been a successful competitive longboarder throughout his teens and into his 20's, making a mark as one of the area's standout logboard nosehounds. Having spent so much time on a surfboard it was only natural for him to gravitate toward surfboard building and working in the surf industry. As a G&amp;S team rider, Micah began to apprentice shape and glass at G&amp;S and then on to different factories, while working in surf shops and learning the craft and it's idiosyncrasies. These days Wood Custom Surfboards is Micah's surfboard label, specializing in quality custom longboard shapes. Micah has a bank of knowledge about shaping, ding repair, glassing and surfboards in general.
